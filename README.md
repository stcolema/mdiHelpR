# mdiHelpR
A repo for some of my MDI helper functions.

This package contains functions to aid Bayesian clustering. Several of the functions rely entirely upon other packages, most noticeably ``coda`` (MCMC diagnostics) and ``pheatmap`` (heatmaps)

Install using:

```{r install_cmd}
devtools::install_github("stcolema/mdiHelpR")
```
